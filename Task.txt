Project: Food Inventory Management System

* Description:
Create a backend API for managing food items, suppliers, and categories within a food inventory system. Users can perform CRUD operations on food items, suppliers, and categories, with features like pagination, search, and filtering. Additionally, implement user authentication using JWT tokens for secure access to API endpoints.

Features:

*Food Item Management:

CRUD operations for food items (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Each food item has attributes such as name, description, category, supplier, price, and quantity.
Pagination, search, and filtering for food items.


*Supplier Management:

CRUD operations for suppliers (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Each supplier has attributes such as name, contact information, and address.
Pagination, search, and filtering for suppliers.


*Category Management:

CRUD operations for categories (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Categories can include fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, grains, etc.
Pagination, search, and filtering for categories.


*User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using JWT tokens for secure access to API endpoints.
Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
JWT tokens are generated upon successful authentication and used to authenticate subsequent requests.


*Optional:

Supplier Login:

Allow suppliers to log in and manage their own supplied items (if applicable).
Suppliers can view, update, and delete items they have supplied.
Implement authorization to ensure suppliers can only manage their own supplied items.

*Tools and Technologies:

Node.js: Use Node.js as the backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Use Express.js for building the RESTful API and handling HTTP requests.
MongoDB: Use MongoDB as the database to store food item, supplier, and category information.
Mongoose: Use Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Use JWT for user authentication and securing API endpoints.
Bcrypt.js (Optional): Use Bcrypt.js for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
Postman (Optional): Use Postman for testing the API endpoints without frontend development.
